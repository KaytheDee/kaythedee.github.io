## Cascade Energy Scholarship 

In April 2025, I was awarded the Cascade Energy Scholarship through the [Renewable Energy Scholarship Foundation](https://www.resf-pnw.org/).

The award ceremony was held at the University of Washington's Clean Energy Testbeds - and I was honoured to meet Erik Holman (Executive Vice President of Operations and Delivery) and Victoria Sonoda-Casper (Executive Assistant) of Cascade Energy. 
Cascade Energy specializes in energy efficiency and decarbonization solutions.

I also got the chance to meet other students, researchers, and industry partners in the renewable energy space.
