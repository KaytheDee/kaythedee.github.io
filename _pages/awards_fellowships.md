## Cascade Energy Scholarship 

In April 2025, I was awarded the Cascade Energy Scholarship through the Renewable Energy Scholarship Foundation. 

The award ceremony was held at the University of Washington's Clean Energy Testbeds - and I was honoured to meet Erik Holman (Executive Vice President of Operations) and Victoria Sonoda-Casper (Executive Assistant) of Cascade Energy. Cascade Energy specializes in energy efficiency and decarbonization solutions. 
You can read more about my award on their website. 

I also got the chance to meet other students, researchers, and industry partners in the renewable energy space.
