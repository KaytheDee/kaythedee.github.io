## STEM Alternative Spring Break (ASB) Program 

In the Winter 2025 quarter, I was privileged to have been appointed team lead of a NASA-funded STEM
[Alternative Spring Break Program](https://cele.uw.edu/students/opportunities/riverways/stem-asb/) at the Quileute Tribal School in La Push, WA. 

I worked with 4 super smart students from diverse backgrounds & majors; Marine Biology, Bioengineering, Computer Science & Applied Math! We met weekly throughout the quarter to prepare an interactive lesson plan on drones.

We then spent the Spring Break week at the Quileute Tribal School interacting with students from Grade 6 to 8, sparking their wonder and curiosity about the importance of drones and its various applications.

We also got to explore the beautiful beaches La Push had to offer!

Thanks to UW Riverways Education Partnerships for this amazing opportunity! 

*Fun fact*: We stayed at the [ONRC](https://www.onrc.washington.edu/) in Forks (30 minutes from La Push). Forks is the rainiest town in the contiguous United States and famously served as the setting for the *Twilight Saga* series!
