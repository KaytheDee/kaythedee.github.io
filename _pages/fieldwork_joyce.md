## Sub‑Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment (S‑MODE) IOP2
Research Assistant (*North Pacific ocean. April 7, 2023 - May 4, 2023*)
* R/V Sally Ride, 26 days at sea
* Assist to deploy Lagrangian floats and APEX floats, convey underwater CTD (uCTD) transaction survey and collect water sample from CTD cast

## Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Summer Program, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
Student Attendant (*virtual. June, 2020 - July, 2020*)
* Attended lectures given and discussions led by such scholars as John A. Whitehead, Joe Pedlosky, Pascale Garaud on a variety of topics, including instability, chaos, turbulence and mixing in and at GFD, stirring, mixing and swimming at GFD, confounding complexities in Rayleigh Bénard Convection

## Coastal hydrodynamics field studies
Student Attendant (*Skåne län, Sweden. November 2017 - December 2017*)
* Studied the severely corroded south coast of Skåne län in light of improper local human behavior and measured beach profile information by global positioning system equipment
* Completed the following MATLAB assignments: 1) correcting wind speed data for different standing positions; and 2) calculating wave height and wave direction changes from deep sea waves to shallow sea breaker and designing proper caisson breakwater and rubble breakwater according to near‑shore wave data

## Cognitive field training in Pearl River Estuary
Student Attendant (*Guangzhou, China. July 2016 - July 2018*)
* Acquired collecting and sampling skills of geography, water systems, sediment movement, and hydraulic conditions as well as equipment usage including YSI, ADCP, OSB and LISST
* Processed water sample for dissolved O2, Organic carbon (TOC), Chl‑a, plankton restoring, sediment sorting, LISST calibration
